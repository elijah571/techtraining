GitHub is a web-based platform and hosting service for version control using Git. 
It provides a collaborative environment for developers to store, manage, and share their code repositories. 
GitHub offers a wide range of features and tools that facilitate software development, collaboration, and project management.

GitHub allows developers to host their Git repositories in the cloud.
Users can create repositories for their projects and push code changes to GitHub,
making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

GitHub leverages Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to codebases over time.
Developers can commit changes, create branches, and merge code changes using Git commands or GitHub's user-friendly interface.

GitHub enables collaboration among team members and open-source contributors. Users can invite collaborators to their repositories, assign tasks, and review code changes using pull requests. 
Collaboration features such as code reviews, issue tracking,
and project boards streamline the development process and foster teamwork.
