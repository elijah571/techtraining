Git is a version control system  that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, 
but it has since become one of the most popular version control systems across various industries and projects.

Git allows developers to track changes to their codebase over time. 
It enables them to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate with others more effectively.

Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed, 
meaning that every user has a complete copy of the entire repository, including its history.
This allows developers to work offline and makes branching and merging more efficient.
